- Programming languages: Python-cs120, Java-cs121/cs222, a little C-cs230, C#-Internship at Formula Boats

- As of recently, I code mostly for my internship in .NET Blazor. I worked on two main projects during my time there this summer. I worked on the rebuilding of a sales quote website in Blazor and an internal site, adding any miscellaneous tools that anyone in the company requested. I built a production schedule to actively pull upcoming boats into a printable table using the JS plugin DataTables. This tool also had the ability to select what department you wanted to see, altering the presented boats based on op seq.
In the sales tool, I rebuilt many different pages, including a page to display your current contacts or leads. On this page, you can delete, add new, or view the quotes attached to your contact. I also built different inventory screens utilizing cards to display each boat with the given details.

- The largest project I have worked on would have to be the sales tool, which took up most of my time during the summer. It was a good experience for me to learn how to translate between frameworks. I had to reference the old project done in ASP.NET MVC, and then rewrite the code in Blazor, using Razor in C# rather than JavaScript.

- I feel fairly comfortable dealing with the process of handling data. During my internship, there were a lot of times when the data I wanted was different than the data I got, so I got a lot of experience using services to get and alter data from the server's database.

- I feel least comfortable doing complex logic in code. Low-level problems are very intimidating to me, and I struggle to work through them promptly. I process things methodically, so it may take longer for me to catch on to new languages or frameworks, but I make sure to learn them well with intention.
